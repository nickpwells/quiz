			<p class="nasa-facts">Did you know that NASA's budget from 1958-2011 was $800B, while the entire military budget in 2011 was nearly $1T?  Currently NASA's funding is at .48% of the US budget.  Research conducted by NASA may save humanity one day, but they need help.  <a href="http://www.penny4nasa.org/mission/">Penny4NASA</a> is a non-profit striving to increase NASA's funding to 1% by encouraging support through education and outreach.  Every donation, no matter how small, can help mankind reach places we've never been before.</p>
